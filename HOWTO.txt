NOTE: setup.py (what I used before is deprecated; trying new instructions)
New Instructions:
From:
https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/

make sure build and twine is installed
pip install --upgrade build
pip install --upgrade twine

delete any dist build or egg files or folders (send to trash to be safe)
note: use the --sdist and --wheel if you have compiled stuff separate
(to build everything)
python -m build

upload to pypi using twine
--
test command
python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

live command
python -m twine upload dist/*

OLD_INSTRUCTIONS with setup.py commands
From:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/reusable-apps/

dont forget to increment the version number in setup.py
NOTE: temporarily move the docroot app to trash using file manager so it doesn't build! then restore after!
NOTE: build using generic pyenv
delete any dist or eggs
python setup.py sdist

To Test:
pip install --upgrade ~/projects/django_docrootcms/dist/django-docrootcms-3.4.tar.gz
